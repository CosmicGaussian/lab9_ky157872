When I run it as just a file in VS code it runs perfectly. In order to push it to GitHub I made a folder and copied my C file to my code to that folder.
When I opened that same folder in VS code, which I do in order to push to get, and I run my copied C file it doesn't run even though it is 
the exact same code.
